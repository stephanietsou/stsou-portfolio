            <h4>UX designer and Psychology graduate passionate about designing with empathy and awareness of others. An inquisitive individual and always looking to figure out the “why” in everything.</h4>
            <p>Based in San Jose, CA, I am currently pursuing a certificate in UX/UI Design from UC Berkeley. I hold a BA in Psychology and Minor in Education from UCB as well.
                <br>
                <br>
            I've worked in several different client- and customer-facing roles –from being a behavioral technician working with kids on the autism spectrum, to working in sales for a small insurtech start-up, I've developed a profound understanding of the customer journey and have become accustomed to working in fast-paced environments that require me to think quick on my feet.
            <br>
            <br>
            Outside of design, I enjoy spending time with family and friends, scouting out new coffee shops to try, and making my sister take candid photos of me around the city.
            <br>
            <br>
            If you want to learn more, shoot me a message! Or, take a peek at my resume here. Let's be friends!
